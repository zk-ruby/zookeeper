v0.8.4 fix NameError, require 'forwardable'
  
  * Really not sure why this didn't come up in tests

  * issue here https://github.com/slyphon/zk/issues/22

v0.8.3 fix NonLocalJump exception in event delivery thread shutdown code

  * hit a corner case where we're waiting for the zkc handle setup
    and the user decides to shutdown, but before we've had a chance
    to enter the delivery loop.

  * Cleaned up some nasty code in ZookeeperConstants

  * removed ZookeeperConstants#print_events and ZookeeperConstants#print_states

  * changed EVENT_TYPE_NAMES and EVENT_STATE_NAMES in ZookeeperConstants
    to use string values instead of symbols

v0.8.2 fix close after a fork()

  * The dispatch thread will be dead in this situation, so we need to 
    check to see if it's already dead before waiting on it to exit.

v0.8.1 Java client fix, silence warnings

v0.8.0 Refactor C implementaion, EventMachine client

  * separated CZookeeper and ZookeeperBase implementation
  
    This solves issues with reopen not working properly, makes for a much
    cleaner event delivery implementation. ZookeeperBase controls the lifecycle
    of the event dispatch thread now, rather than it being tied to CZookeeper.
  
  * added support for the 'sync' API call
  
  * Refactored zookeeper_c.c and zookeeper_lib.c
  
    More error checking in zookeeper_lib.c and restructure some things to make
    logic easier to follow
  
    Fix bug in method_get_next_event that made the shutdown case so complicated
  
  * Massively simplified EMClient implementation

    Rather than trying to hook the IO used by zookeeper_lib to notify zookeeper_c
    about event availabiltiy directly into EventMachine, use the same event delivery
    thread, but wrap the dispatch call in EM.schedule.

  * Improve implementation of spin-lock-esque code that waits for the connection to be
    established before returning.

    This cut the test runtime down from 1m 20s to 2s.

  * Java client refactoring, similar correctness changes

  * Change ZookeeperException base class to StandardError instead of Exception
