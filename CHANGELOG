v1.4.6

  * Fix two issues with dealing with unresponsive zookeeper servers
    that would prevent the client from properly recovering the session
    (including one in the Apache ZooKeeper C library — see ZOOKEEPER-1756
    for more details)
  * Reduce the chances of seeing Zookeeper::Exceptions::NotConnected
    exceptions by only submitting new commands if we are connected
  * Prevent commands from being queued to be sent to the server if the
    session has expired which will solve most cases involving the
    Zookeeper::Exceptions::ContinuationTimeoutError exception
  * Upgrade the Apache ZooKeeper C library to 3.4.5 (client is backward
    compatible with 3.3 servers). The Java library has not been updated.
  * Cleanup complaints from compiler for uninitialized variable access

v1.4.5

  * Allow passing :session_id and :session_password options #42 (thanks to avalanche123)
  * Fix permissions constants #46, #47, #48 (thanks to jaeho-kim)
  * Allow JRuby to read nil values #44 (thanks to reidmorrison)


v1.4.4 fix build under FreeBSD (h/t: stass)

  * https://github.com/slyphon/zookeeper/pull/40 

v1.4.3 fix build for ruby 2.0.0-rc2

  * https://github.com/slyphon/zookeeper/pull/34

v1.4.2 fix a bug in the forwarding logger format string

v1.4.1 merge pull request 29 - fix exception handling in jruby 1.7.x

  * h/t to @dynamix for the patch


v1.4.0 Removed the 'logging' gem

  * At the request of a user, use of the logging gem has been discontinued as
    it appears to cause a fair amount of RSS memory bloating (8MB was
    reported).  It's been replaced by a fairly simple ad-hoc implementation
    using the stdlib 'logger' class. No user impact is expected unless you were
    adjusting the Loggers on components of zookeeper.

v1.3.0 much needed refactor of event and async result delivery

  * event and async blocks were previously mixed in with a bunch of other
    common code, and shared a Monitor with other unrelated functionality. This
    code has been gently refactored into its own self-contained class (with its
    own task-specific lock), which should help with maintenance.

v1.2.14 merge add_auth pull request, reduce chances for ContinuationTimeoutError

  * added support for the add_auth call (h/t: @bradhe) see pull req #25

  * fix a corner case where some pending Continuations may get stuck without
    being shutdown when the event thread exits. This would lead to a 
    ContinuationTimeoutError being raised after 30s as a failsafe. 

v1.2.13 fix build under rbenv

  * h/t to Eric Lindvall for fixing #22 in http://git.io/PEPgnA
    build reportedly works in rbenv now.

v1.2.12 improve locking in dispatch_next_callback

  * Possible fix for an edgy NoMethodError on nil

v1.2.11 remove dependency on backports gem

  * Somewhat naively we were requiring the backports gem to provide
    Kernel#require_relative. This release implements similar functionlity
    inside the Zookeeper module and doesn't affect the global namespace.

    We apologise for the inconvenience.

v1.2.10 minor bug fix in java code
  
  * Don't obscure a legitimate exception because of an unexpected nil

v1.2.7 further lock adjustments, deadlock risk reduction

  * Refactor ZookeeperBase to not hold onto the mutex while waiting
    for the dispatch thread to exit and the CZookeeper instance to close.
    Instead, lock, nil out @czk, and unlock (which will cause all calls to
    raise NotConnected), and then carry on with the shutdown procedure, greatly
    reducing the chances of a deadlock. Also add a hardcoded 30 second timeout
    to the join of the shutdown thread, that way we won't hang indefinitely in
    the case of an unforseen condition.

  * Improve the CZookeeper#wait_until_connected to use a deadline approach
    to waiting for both running and connected states. Also, handle the 
    'nil' (wait forever) timeout properly.

  * Wake all waiting threads on all ConditionVariables when CZookeeper#shut_down!
    is called

v1.2.6 fix build on fedora

v1.2.5 cleanup locking in ZookeeperBase

  * There were several situations where we would hold the lock before calling
    a method on CZookeeper (inquisitors and #create in particular). This
    exposed us to deadlocks in situations where an async event would be
    delivered (probably a SESSION_EXPIRED event), but the callback block could
    not be called because the dispatch thread would block on the mutex being
    held by the caller of create. 

    This version cleans up that usage, and ensures that the only time we hold
    the mutex is during startup/shutdown (when the value of @czk may be changing),
    and in all other cases we grab the mutex, dereference, and unlock then perform
    whatever action on the reference. 

  * Add a safety net to Continuation (which will soon be called 'Promise' or
    'Future' at the request of @eric). If any operation takes more than 30s
    an exception will be raised in the calling thread. The session timeout
    setting makes it so that no operation should take more than 20s, so we know
    if we haven't received a reply in *longer* than that, something has gone
    awry. 

v1.2.4 fix buffer overflow in CZookeeper client_id code
  
  * the 'passwd' part of the struct is a char[16], but isn't null terminated.
    use rb_str_new with an explicit length, rather than rb_str_new2 which
    uses strlen().
    
v1.2.3 ensure that all threads are woken up on shutdown

  * There was an edge case where a call would be queued up and its thread
    sleeping waiting for a response, but that response would never come because
    the connection was shut down. This version includes a patch for that case
    to ensure that if a call is in 'pending' state, and shutdown time arrives
    that all pending threads will receive a Zookeeper::Exceptions::NotConnected
    exception.

v1.2.2 avoid race while waiting for connection

  * There was a possible race in CZookeeper#wait_until_connected where if we
    couldn't connect to the port specified (localhost:28271) then we wound up
    burning 100% CPU and spinning. This solution fixes that by hooking into the
    event delivery and keeping track of what the current state is. When there's
    a change, we use a ConditionVariable to wake up threads that were waiting
    until the connection was connected. Additionally, we now respect the
    timeout parameter again.

v1.2.1 simplify assert_open

  * The client methods were all calling assert_open before performing an
    action. This was meant as a fail-early lightweight check of the connection
    state and it worked well when we were running against the mt code. Now this
    requires us to use a Continuation and make our way through the event loop.
    There is a possible deadlock this release should solve that was caused by 
    the assert_open code holding a lock while making an async call through
    the event loop. This is no longer the case. The assert_open call only checks
    that the current handle hasn't been closed, the connection-state checking
    now occurs before submitting a request on the event iteration thread, and
    the behavior should be the same as it was before. If the underlying
    connection is not in the 'connected' state, an exception will be raised.

v1.2.0 Stop the World, I Wanna fork()

  * changed pause/resume methods to pause_before_fork_in_parent
    and resume_after_fork_in_parent to match their ZK counterparts

  * replaced the Queue in QueueWithPipe (really have to change that name)
    with an Array and Mutex/ConditionVariable pair. This allows us to 
    have better control over the shutdown signaling, and lets us resume
    operations after a pause.


v1.1.1 Cleanup after code review (h/t @eric)

  * While hunting down this bug: https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6438
    Eric Lindvall made a number of helpful catches.

  * Reduce syscall overhead by not using an unnecessary pipe in the event_lib.c
    implementation

  * More careful use of rb_raise, don't longjmp past necessary free() calls.

  * More careful malloc in the get() implementation (we need to allocate 1MB
    to hold the data in a znode, but only in the SYNC cases).


v1.1.0 Rewrite C backend to use zookeeper_st, the async library

  * In order to ensure fork safety, a rewrite of the backend was necessary.
    It was impossible to guarantee with the mt lib that a lock would not
    be held by a thread when fork() was called, which opened up the possibility
    for corruption and other badness.

    This version contains a Continuation class, which allows us to present a 
    synchronous front-end to the asynchronous backend. All features are still
    supported, no special action is necessary to prepare for a fork, and the
    post-fork procedure is the same as before: call reopen() in the child,
    continue on in the parent like nothing happened.

v1.0.6 Only include backports if RUBY_VERSION is 1.8.x

  * 'backports' pollutes too much, use sparingly

v1.0.5 Minor cleanup

  * Fix the InheritedConnectionError message

  * Clean up the module includes

v1.0.3 Linux: Fix hang on reopen after fork

  * Linux users relying on fork() should upgrade to 1.0.3, as it
    fixes a bug in the reopen code that would cause a hang in the child.
    If you're running on linux, you *really* should upgrade

v1.0.0 Single Zookeeper namespace

  * The top level Zookeeper class is now a module, the former Zookeeper
    class is now Zookeeper::Client

  * Consolidate the 6 top-level namespaces into one, Zookeeper module

    ZookeeperCommon -> Zookeeper::Common
    ZookeeperCallbacks -> Zookeeper::Callbacks
    ZookeeperConstants -> Zookeeper::Constants
    ZookeeperExceptions -> Zookeeper::Exceptions
    ZookeeperACLs -> Zookeeper::ACLs
    CZookeeper -> Zookeeper::CZookeeper

  * Added a 'zookeeper/compatibility' file that will define the old names
    and look up the new constants for users, and print a warning telling them
    the change has occurred and that they should update their code

  * Added scripts/upgrade-1.0-sed-alike.rb which will basically do a
    find-and-replace, changing the old names to the new names (worked on
    both the Zookeeper and ZK codebases).

  * Java and C now use different names for the base class, to avoid the
    possibility of error. Java is now JavaBase, C remains ZookeeperBase.
    
  * All client methods are defined in the ClientMethods module and mixed
    into the constructed Client class.

  * Fix all requires, no longer monkey with $LOAD_PATH, use require_relative

  * Bugfix for C client. 
  
    Because we release the GIL, there's the possibilty that in the middle of a
    synchronous C call, ruby will have switched thread contexts and one of
    those threads will call close. It seems that during normal operation, this
    is not a problem, but during shutdown, this causes CPU to spike to 100% and
    a deadlock. This fix essentially wraps every call to the C layer in a
    mutex. There may be a slightly less heavyweight optimization in the future,
    but this is the safest option at the moment.

v0.9.3 Event thread shutdown fix, Windows compatibility fix

  * Use a 'shutdown thread' to coordinate cleanup if close is called from the
    event thread (prevents deadlock)

  * Default Logger now uses $stderr instead of opening /dev/null [#16]

  * Gemfile/gemspec/Rakefile refactoring.

v0.9.2 More efficient and simpler wrappers for GIL release

  * After a code review by Andrew Wason (rectalogic), use a much simpler
    technique for creating the arg structs and passing them to the
    zkrb_gvl_* functions. No malloc(), no free(), no problem.

v0.9.1 see v0.8.4 notes, same patch

v0.9.0 RELEASE THE KRAK..er, GIL!!

  * In >= 1.9.2 the ruby interpreter allows you to release the GIL when
    calling into native code, sounds like a good idea.
    
    This release makes use of that code by parsing the zookeeper.h header file
    and extracting the method signatures of all relevant zoo_* functions, then
    generating boilerplate that allows us to call those functions via the
    rb_thread_blocking_region function.

    1.8.7 compatibility is maintained by stubbing out that functionality if built
    under 1.8.7. 

  * 1.8.7 is deprecated! I will continue to support 1.8.7 for the near future
    but sometime soon, you're gonna have to upgrade.

v0.8.4 fix NameError, require 'forwardable'
  
  * Really not sure why this didn't come up in tests

  * issue here https://github.com/slyphon/zk/issues/22

v0.8.3 fix NonLocalJump exception in event delivery thread shutdown code

  * hit a corner case where we're waiting for the zkc handle setup
    and the user decides to shutdown, but before we've had a chance
    to enter the delivery loop.

  * Cleaned up some nasty code in ZookeeperConstants

  * removed ZookeeperConstants#print_events and ZookeeperConstants#print_states

  * changed EVENT_TYPE_NAMES and EVENT_STATE_NAMES in ZookeeperConstants
    to use string values instead of symbols

v0.8.2 fix close after a fork()

  * The dispatch thread will be dead in this situation, so we need to 
    check to see if it's already dead before waiting on it to exit.

v0.8.1 Java client fix, silence warnings

v0.8.0 Refactor C implementaion, EventMachine client

  * separated CZookeeper and ZookeeperBase implementation
  
    This solves issues with reopen not working properly, makes for a much
    cleaner event delivery implementation. ZookeeperBase controls the lifecycle
    of the event dispatch thread now, rather than it being tied to CZookeeper.
  
  * added support for the 'sync' API call
  
  * Refactored zookeeper_c.c and zookeeper_lib.c
  
    More error checking in zookeeper_lib.c and restructure some things to make
    logic easier to follow
  
    Fix bug in method_get_next_event that made the shutdown case so complicated
  
  * Massively simplified EMClient implementation

    Rather than trying to hook the IO used by zookeeper_lib to notify zookeeper_c
    about event availabiltiy directly into EventMachine, use the same event delivery
    thread, but wrap the dispatch call in EM.schedule.

  * Improve implementation of spin-lock-esque code that waits for the connection to be
    established before returning.

    This cut the test runtime down from 1m 20s to 2s.

  * Java client refactoring, similar correctness changes

  * Change ZookeeperException base class to StandardError instead of Exception
